Powered by Mantle Network. Backend emits events via smart contracts when properties are created. Frontend subscribes using Wagmi hooks for real-time updates. Socket.io handles multiplayer events. On-chain events stream directly to your browser. Fast updates without polling. Low latency. High performance. Database-like speed with blockchain security.

## RWA Integration

Properties linked to tokenized real estate. Each property NFT backed by real-world asset. Real yield from actual rental income. Transparent distribution on-chain. Verifiable ownership. Compliant with regulations. KYC flow for RWA investments. Fractional ownership supported. Multiple properties per RWA. Yield distributed proportionally.

Linking property to RWA updates yield calculation. YieldDistributor contract checks if property is linked to RWA. If linked, uses RWA value and yield rate for yield calculation. If not linked, uses property's own value and yield rate. Automatic fallback ensures backward compatibility. All existing linked properties benefit immediately.

Uses MockRWA contract for demo and testing. ERC-721 compatible. Replaced with real RWA contracts in production. Chronicle Oracle integration ready for RWA property values. Frontend supports both oracle-based and MockRWA contracts.

## Yield Distribution

First place wins 40 percent of yield pool. Second place wins 25 percent. Third place wins 15 percent. Places four through ten split 10 percent. All players split 10 percent participation rewards.

Minimum one property required to qualify.

## What You Own

Your property NFTs belong to you. Trade them. Sell them. Keep them. Your TYCOON tokens belong to you. Spend them. Hold them. Your yield belongs to you. Claim it. Reinvest it. Your portfolio stays on blockchain forever. Your rewards stay in your wallet.

## Mantle Integration

We use Mantle SDK for cross-chain messaging. Asset bridging between L1 and L2. Deposit and withdrawal estimation. Message status tracking. L1 to L2 asset transfers for RWA tokenization.

We use Mantle Viem for type-safe contract interactions. Wagmi and Viem integration. Efficient data fetching with automatic caching. Real-time event subscriptions. Optimized RPC calls leveraging Mantle throughput.

We use Mantle custom RPC methods. eth_getBlockRange for batch block queries. rollup_getInfo for L2 node status. Gas price optimization using Mantle GasPriceOracle. Custom API methods for performance.

We use Mantle GasPriceOracle for gas optimization. L1 base fee tracking. L2 gas price optimization. Transaction cost estimation. Batch transaction support.

## Chronicle Oracle

Uses Chronicle Oracle for price feeds on Mantle Sepolia. 60 to 80 percent less gas than other oracles. Critical for frequent yield calculations. Property value updates cost less.

Schnorr-based architecture ensures secure price feeds. Data freshness validation with 3-hour default threshold. tryReadWithAge functions prevent reverts. Graceful fallbacks if oracle data is stale.

Chronicle Oracle addresses on Mantle Sepolia:
- USDC/USD: 0x9Dd500569A6e77ECdDE7694CDc2E58ac587768D0
- USDT/USD: 0xD671F5F7c2fb6f75439641C36a578842f5b376A9
- ETH/USD: 0xa6896dCf3f5Dc3c29A5bD3a788D6b7e901e487D8
- MNT/USD: 0xCE0F753FDEEE2D0EC5F1ba086bD7d5087C20c307

Backend fetches real-time prices for USDC, USDT, ETH, and MNT. Price feeds used for yield calculations and property valuations. RWA property values fetched from Chronicle when configured. Falls back to contract queries if Chronicle oracle not available.

## MockRWA

Uses MockRWA for demo and testing. Allows testing RWA linking without real tokenized assets. Perfect for hackathons and demos. Developers test property linking without deploying real RWA contracts. Easy to mint test properties to different addresses.

MockRWA implements ERC-721 standard. Replaced with any real RWA contract following the same interface. Real RWA platforms require KYC and compliance. MockRWA allows immediate testing and demos.

Frontend checks for NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_RWA_ADDRESS environment variable. If set, uses oracle-based RWA contract. If not set, falls back to MockRWA contract. Backend uses Chronicle Oracle for RWA property values when CHRONICLE_RWA_PROPERTY_ORACLE is configured. System handles both mock and real RWA contracts.
