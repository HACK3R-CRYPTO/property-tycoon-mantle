Step three: Mint your property. Spend 100 TYCOON tokens. One-time cost per property. Choose property type. Residential for stability. Commercial for balance. Industrial for higher yield. Luxury for maximum returns. Your property NFT stays in your wallet. View it in your collection. See it on your map. Property is yours forever.

Step four: Link to RWA. Connect your property to tokenized real estate. Select RWA contract. Enter token ID. Link confirmed. Your property now generates real yield from rental income. No additional cost.
