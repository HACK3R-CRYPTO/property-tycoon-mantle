## Your First Property

Step one: Connect your wallet. Use MetaMask or WalletConnect. Switch to Mantle Sepolia Testnet. Get test tokens from faucet.

Step two: Buy TYCOON tokens. One-time purchase to get started. Send MNT to swap contract. One MNT buys 100 TYCOON tokens. Buy enough for your first property. Buy more later if you want to expand. No recurring payments. No subscriptions.

Step three: Mint your property. Spend 100 TYCOON tokens. One-time cost per property. Choose property type. Residential for stability. Commercial for balance. Industrial for higher yield. Luxury for maximum returns. Your property NFT stays in your wallet. View it in your collection. See it on your map. Property is yours forever. **Your level and XP update automatically** when you mint!

Step four: Link to RWA. Connect your property to tokenized real estate. Select RWA contract. Enter token ID. Link confirmed. Your property now generates real yield from rental income. No additional cost.

Step five: Collect yield. Properties generate yield daily. Free money. No cost to collect. Claim your yield rewards. Yield distributed as USDC or USDT. Real money in your wallet. Transparent on-chain distribution. Keep the yield or reinvest. **Your level and XP update automatically** when you claim yield!

Step six: Expand your portfolio. Use collected yield to buy more TYCOON tokens. Mint more properties. Or keep the yield as profit. Your choice. No pressure to keep buying. Properties keep generating yield.

Step seven: Visit other players. Click leaderboard. See top tycoons. Visit their portfolios. See how they built their empires. Get inspired. Learn strategies. Use FIND button in property cards to center map on any property. View dynamic location coordinates in bottom-left corner showing current viewport position.

Step eight: Complete quests. Finish investment challenges. Diversify your portfolio. Optimize your yield. Earn bonus rewards. Unlock achievements. Climb the leaderboard.

Luxury Properties: Premium real estate. Highest yield around 15 percent APY. Highest cost. Maximum returns. Exclusive properties. High-value assets. For serious tycoons. Costs 1000 TYCOON tokens to mint. Generates yield daily. No maintenance cost.

## Purchasing Model

One-time token purchase to get started. Buy TYCOON tokens with MNT. Use tokens to mint properties. Each property costs tokens one time. No recurring payments. No subscriptions. No maintenance fees.

Properties generate yield daily. Free money. No cost to collect. Claim yield as USDC or USDT. Real money in your wallet. Keep the yield or reinvest. Your choice.

Expand when you want. Use collected yield to buy more tokens. Mint more properties. Or keep the yield as profit. No pressure to keep buying. Properties keep generating yield forever.

Example: Buy 1000 TYCOON tokens once. Mint 5 properties. Properties generate yield daily. Collect yield. Use yield to expand or keep money. No more token purchases needed unless you want to grow faster.

## Leveling System

Earn experience points (XP) and level up as you build your property empire! Your level is calculated from three factors:

1. **Properties Owned**: 100 XP per property
2. **Yield Earned**: 1 XP per 0.01 TYC earned
3. **Portfolio Value**: 1 XP per 0.1 TYC in portfolio

**Level Formula**: `Level = floor(√(Total XP / 1000)) + 1`

**Level Titles**:
- **Level 1-4**: "RISING TYCOON" 🌱
- **Level 5-9**: "PRO TYCOON" 💼
- **Level 10-14**: "ELITE TYCOON" ⭐
- **Level 15-19**: "MASTER TYCOON" 👑
- **Level 20+**: "LEGENDARY TYCOON" 🏆

Your level updates **automatically in real-time** via WebSocket when you:
- Mint a property (100 XP per property)
- Purchase a property (XP based on property value)
- Claim yield (XP based on yield amount)

No page refresh needed! See your level, XP progress, and progress bar update instantly in the left sidebar. Backend calculates level server-side from blockchain data for accuracy and security.

See [LEVELING_SYSTEM.md](LEVELING_SYSTEM.md) for detailed documentation.

See leaderboard shifts. See other players join. See properties traded. **Level and XP update automatically** when you mint properties, purchase properties, or claim yield. All without page refresh.

Powered by Mantle Network. Backend emits events via smart contracts when properties are created. Frontend subscribes using Wagmi hooks for real-time updates. Socket.io handles multiplayer events. On-chain events stream directly to your browser. Fast updates without polling. Low latency. High performance. Database-like speed with blockchain security.

### Real-Time Level/XP Updates

Your level and XP update automatically via WebSocket when you:
- **Mint a property** → XP increases by 100 (1 property × 100 XP)
- **Purchase a property** → XP increases based on property value
- **Claim yield** → XP increases based on yield amount

No page refresh needed. Level, XP, and progress bar update instantly in the UI. Backend calculates level server-side from blockchain data (properties, yield, portfolio value) and broadcasts updates via WebSocket. Frontend receives `user:level-update` events and updates the display immediately.

## RWA Integration

Properties linked to tokenized real estate. Each property NFT backed by real-world asset. Real yield from actual rental income. Transparent distribution on-chain. Verifiable ownership. Compliant with regulations. KYC flow for RWA investments. Fractional ownership supported. Multiple properties per RWA. Yield distributed proportionally.

Linking property to RWA updates yield calculation. YieldDistributor contract checks if property is linked to RWA. If linked, uses RWA value and yield rate for yield calculation. If not linked, uses property's own value and yield rate. Automatic fallback ensures backward compatibility. All existing linked properties benefit immediately. Frontend and backend also use RWA data for estimated yield calculations. Estimated yield display updates in real time using RWA value and yield rate when property is linked.

**YieldDistributor Status:** The contract is deployed and configured at address `0x3F15825DD678D56250ea155bDeac8684369966b3`. YieldDistributor is authorized to mint TYCOON tokens when users claim yield. The contract uses RWA data (value and yield rate) when properties are linked to RWA contracts. Yield calculation dynamically uses each RWA's specific value and APY from the RWA contract. Each RWA token in MockRWA has its own value and yield rate, so the daily yield depends on which RWA token is linked. MockRWA includes 5 test tokens with different APYs: Token #0 (6% APY), Token #1 (9% APY), Token #2 (12% APY), Token #3 (15% APY), and Token #4 (8% APY). The property's base value and yield rate are only used if the property is not linked to RWA or if the RWA data is unavailable. The contract includes gas-optimized RWA calls and tracks `propertyTotalYieldEarned` for each property, which the frontend reads to display total yield earned per property.

**Note:** Currently using MockRWA contract for this demo. Chronicle Oracle integration is fully implemented and ready for production use, but we are using MockRWA for demo and testing purposes. MockRWA is ERC-721 compatible and can be replaced with real RWA contracts in production. Frontend supports both oracle-based and MockRWA contracts. To use real Chronicle Oracle RWA, configure the appropriate environment variables.

## Yield Distribution

First place wins 40 percent of yield pool. Second place wins 25 percent. Third place wins 15 percent. Places four through ten split 10 percent. All players split 10 percent participation rewards.

Minimum one property required to qualify.

## What You Own

Your property NFTs belong to you. Trade them. Sell them. Keep them. Your TYCOON tokens belong to you. Spend them. Hold them. Your yield belongs to you. Claim it. Reinvest it. Your portfolio stays on blockchain forever. Your rewards stay in your wallet.

We use Mantle Viem for type-safe contract interactions. Wagmi and Viem integration. Efficient data fetching with automatic caching. Real-time event subscriptions. Optimized RPC calls leveraging Mantle throughput.

We use Mantle custom RPC methods. eth_getBlockRange for batch block queries. rollup_getInfo for L2 node status. Gas price optimization using Mantle GasPriceOracle. Custom API methods for performance.

We use Mantle GasPriceOracle for gas optimization. L1 base fee tracking. L2 gas price optimization. Transaction cost estimation. Batch transaction support.

## Chronicle Oracle

Uses Chronicle Oracle for price feeds on Mantle Sepolia. 60 to 80 percent less gas than other oracles. Critical for frequent yield calculations. Property value updates cost less.

Schnorr-based architecture ensures secure price feeds. Data freshness validation with 3-hour default threshold. tryReadWithAge functions prevent reverts. Graceful fallbacks if oracle data is stale.

Chronicle Oracle addresses on Mantle Sepolia:
- USDC/USD: 0x9Dd500569A6e77ECdDE7694CDc2E58ac587768D0
- USDT/USD: 0xD671F5F7c2fb6f75439641C36a578842f5b376A9
- ETH/USD: 0xa6896dCf3f5Dc3c29A5bD3a788D6b7e901e487D8
- MNT/USD: 0xCE0F753FDEEE2D0EC5F1ba086bD7d5087C20c307

Chronicle Oracle integration is implemented and actively used for USD price conversions. Frontend displays all TYCOON amounts with USD equivalents using real-time MNT/USD price from Chronicle Oracle. Backend fetches price via whitelisted wallet and broadcasts updates via Socket.io every 5 minutes. Frontend receives real-time price updates without page refresh.

**Active Usage:**
- Frontend displays all TYCOON amounts with USD equivalents using Chronicle Oracle MNT/USD price feed
- Property values, yield amounts, and portfolio totals show both TYCOON and USD
- Real-time price updates via Socket.io without page refresh
- Uses Chronicle Oracle address: `0xCE0F753FDEEE2D0EC5F1ba086bD7d5087C20c307` (MNT/USD on Mantle Sepolia)
- Exchange rate: 1 MNT = 100 TYCOON, so TYCOON/USD = MNT/USD ÷ 100
- Backend wallet must be whitelisted on Chronicle Oracle for price fetching

**Other Price Feeds:**
Backend has methods for USDC, USDT, and ETH price feeds, but these are not currently used. They are available for future features like multi-currency support.

**RWA Property Values:**
RWA property values can be fetched from Chronicle when `CHRONICLE_RWA_PROPERTY_ORACLE` is configured, but this environment variable is not set in the demo. The system falls back to contract queries (MockRWA) when Chronicle oracle is not configured.

**Note:** Chronicle Oracle MNT/USD price feed is actively used for USD display with real-time updates. For RWA property values, we are using MockRWA contract instead of real Chronicle Oracle RWA data. To use real Chronicle Oracle RWA, configure `CHRONICLE_RWA_PROPERTY_ORACLE` environment variable in backend and `NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_RWA_ADDRESS` in frontend.

## MockRWA

**Currently using MockRWA for this demo.** Uses MockRWA for demo and testing purposes. Allows testing RWA linking without real tokenized assets. Perfect for hackathons and demos. Developers test property linking without deploying real RWA contracts. Easy to mint test properties to different addresses.

MockRWA implements ERC-721 standard. Replaced with any real RWA contract following the same interface. Real RWA platforms require KYC and compliance. MockRWA allows immediate testing and demos.

**Note:** Chronicle Oracle integration is fully implemented and ready for production. For this demo, we are using MockRWA instead of real Chronicle Oracle RWA data. Frontend checks for NEXT_PUBLIC_ORACLE_RWA_ADDRESS environment variable. If set, uses oracle-based RWA contract. If not set, falls back to MockRWA contract. Backend uses Chronicle Oracle for RWA property values when CHRONICLE_RWA_PROPERTY_ORACLE is configured. System handles both mock and real RWA contracts seamlessly.
