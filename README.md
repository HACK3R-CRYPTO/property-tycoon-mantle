## Your First Property

Step one: Connect your wallet. Use MetaMask or WalletConnect. Switch to Mantle Sepolia Testnet. Get test tokens from faucet.

Step two: Buy TYCOON tokens. One-time purchase to get started. Send MNT to swap contract. One MNT buys 100 TYCOON tokens. Buy enough for your first property. Buy more later if you want to expand. No recurring payments. No subscriptions.

Step three: Mint your property. Spend 100 TYCOON tokens. One-time cost per property. Choose property type. Residential for stability. Commercial for balance. Industrial for higher yield. Luxury for maximum returns. Your property NFT stays in your wallet. View it in your collection. See it on your map. Property is yours forever.

Step four: Link to RWA. Connect your property to tokenized real estate. Select RWA contract. Enter token ID. Link confirmed. Your property now generates real yield from rental income. No additional cost.

Step five: Collect yield. Properties generate yield daily. Free money. No cost to collect. Claim your yield rewards. Yield distributed as USDC or USDT. Real money in your wallet. Transparent on-chain distribution. Keep the yield or reinvest.

Step six: Expand your portfolio. Use collected yield to buy more TYCOON tokens. Mint more properties. Or keep the yield as profit. Your choice. No pressure to keep buying. Properties keep generating yield.

Step seven: Visit other players. Click leaderboard. See top tycoons. Visit their portfolios. See how they built their empires. Get inspired. Learn strategies.

Step eight: Complete quests. Finish investment challenges. Diversify your portfolio. Optimize your yield. Earn bonus rewards. Unlock achievements. Climb the leaderboard.

## Purchasing Model

One-time token purchase to get started. Buy TYCOON tokens with MNT. Use tokens to mint properties. Each property costs tokens one time. No recurring payments. No subscriptions. No maintenance fees.

Properties generate yield daily. Free money. No cost to collect. Claim yield as USDC or USDT. Real money in your wallet. Keep the yield or reinvest. Your choice.

Expand when you want. Use collected yield to buy more tokens. Mint more properties. Or keep the yield as profit. No pressure to keep buying. Properties keep generating yield forever.

Example: Buy 1000 TYCOON tokens once. Mint 5 properties. Properties generate yield daily. Collect yield. Use yield to expand or keep money. No more token purchases needed unless you want to grow faster.
